# Regression Model Project

This project implements a regression model to predict the value of logS based on various features.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have Python and the following Python libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip, as follows:
 
 ``` pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib ```
 
 Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the Jupyter Notebook `Regression_Model.ipynb` to train the regression model and generate predictions for new data.
